Currently the best ideas are presented in the classes that are initializing the databases.

Tree structure means either JSON or XML. The demo does not make difference between these formats. Graph means property graphs. RDF graphs are technically dealt separately.

The following join operations are currently implemented:

- [x] Relational + Relational: inner and left joins
- [x] Relational + Tree: inner and left joins
- [x] Relational + Graph: inner and left joins
- [x] Tree + Relational
- [x] Tree + Tree
- [x] Tree + Graph
- [x] Graph + Relational: inner and left joins
- [x] Graph + Tree
- [x] Graph + Graph: inner, left and right joins
