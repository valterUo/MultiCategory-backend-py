## Resources

This folder contains initial datasets for the demo system. Eventually these datasets would be

1. Small dataset of E-commerce (relational, property graph, XML and key-value pairs)
2. Patent dataset (relational and graph)
3. Unibench SF10 and SF30 (relational, graph, XML, JSON)
3. Online market place dataset (relational, property graph, XML, JSON, RDF)
4. Person dataset
5. University dataset
6. Film dataset (RDF, JSON)

Some of the datasets are relatively big (30gb). Graph features are executed in-memory which requires usually lots of RAM.
